#### text: Claims about the use of software engineering practices in science: a systematic literature review

<p>LM1: Scientific software developers generally do not use a for-mal software development methodology.
We identified nine stud-ies that made this claim[2,3,16–21]. Instead of using a formal devel-opment methodology,
scientists develop their software as follows:</p>

1. The developer forms a basic idea of what is needed and beginscoding.
2. The developer informally evaluates the software through ques-tions like “does this software do what I want?” and
“Can it beusefully extended”?
3. The developer either modifies or extends the code as appropri-ate until the answer to the first question above is
“yes”, and theanswer to the second is “no”.
4.The developer “tests” the software by asking “is the outputbroadly what I expect?”
